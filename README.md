# RoboBrain
An application for wirelessly controlling an Arduino robot. 

The application is designed to be run on two different devices, 
one attached to the robot which interfaces with it through bluetooth 
and the other with the 'pilot' to relay instructions to the robot over UDP. 
Also being developed is a Android Wear version which connects directly to
the robot over bluetooth.
A video streaming component is intended in future to allow the 'pilot' access to the
other device's camera remotely.
